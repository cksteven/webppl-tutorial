# README

This repo is my code working on this tutorial: https://agentmodels.org/

## issues

I didn't succesfully set up the viz package environment on my local machine. Please paste the code and run it on https://agentmodels.org/ or http://webppl.org/.

I'm planning to use http://webppl.org/ as my IDE for now.
